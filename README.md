# xml-json-tasks-21.2

There are two tasks from the lesson 21.2, which includes:

- Parsing XML from JavaScript
- Parsing JSON from JavaScript

There are two files in this repository which solves these tasks. The files are named:

```none
task-{number}.js
```

where `{number}` is the number of the task.

## Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ivan-developer-01/xml-json-tasks-21.1.git
   ```

2. Go to the repository:

   ```shell
   cd xml-json-tasks-21.1
   ```

3. Run files:

   Note that the task-1 cannot be run in Node because it uses `DOMParser`, which is available only in browsers.

   ```shell
   $ node task-2.js
   ...
   ```

   Assuming you have Node installed.  
   If you do not have Node or want to run `task-1.js`, you can copy the code from files and paste it into your browser console.
